# Flip Clock

This began as a coding challenge: to implement an analog flip clock using CSS and Javascript. I had so much fun, I went ahead and build it out in React because, well, React is awesome! Enjoy!

## How does it work?
The major CSS concept that makes this work is "perspective" as well as 3-D rotations ("rotateY"). Check out the documentation on perspective on MDN [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective).
